HTML, CSS and JS.

Work in progress to implement most of the conditions with the drag and drop and make some sense according to the game rules. I have created a navigation bar and a structure made of divs to display the stack, the waste, the spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs piles and a second row with seven piles. In my first attempt I made a table with rows but it was much easier using divs when I started to modify everything with CSS. I have had many problems trying to put the image I was dragging on top of another one. Everything has to say with their position, absolute and relative positions.
